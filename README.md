##Status

Just vaporware at the moment.  The idea is to write it as a website so it can be used anywhere.

##About

Simple static site with a countdown timer which will then count *UP* after it finishes.

This is so you can get into the _zone_ and know how much longer you were there than your minimum required time.

Good job, you!

##Name

瞑想頑張れ is made of two Japanese words: 瞑想 "Meiso" meaning meditation, and 頑張れ "gambare" meaning "do one's best".
